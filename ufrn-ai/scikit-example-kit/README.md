# Machine learning models examples

Set of machine learning examples with each model available in the Scikit-learn library, which are:

- Supervised Learning (linear regression, support vector machines, random forest, neural nets, ...)
- Unsupervised Learning (clustering, PCA, mixture models, manifold learning, ...)
- Dataset Transformation (preprocessing, text feature extraction, one-hot encoding, ...)
